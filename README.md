The technical task was to create a site with recipes with additional functionality. The essence of the project is a site with recipes with the possibility to buy products for these recipes. This is a team work of 5 people, two testers, 2 back-end in Java, and I am the front-end. The technology stack I used. To be able to make a purchase, you need to register as a user. JWT authentication using the Bearer token is also implemented.
Back-End is currently on maintenance.
The project is deployed on aws, and website is live at https://dev6379.dlymbcthwyxq5.amplifyapp.com/
